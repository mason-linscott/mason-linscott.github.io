I am an NSF Graduate Fellow, working in the [Parent lab](http://webpages.uidaho.edu/parentlab/Parent_lab/Parent_lab___Home.html) at the [University of Idaho's Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Program](http://www.uidaho.edu/cogs/bcb). 

My research is focused on understanding the impetus driving shifts between adaptive zones and their consequences. My current projects focus on flight loss in Galpagos Coleoptera, and life-history shifts across land snail Pulmonates.
